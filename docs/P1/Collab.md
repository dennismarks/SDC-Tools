### Weekly Meeting
As a team, we try to follow the agile method.
We meet every Friday from 4pm-6pm at BA3200 for our weekly scrum meeting. We chose Friday 4pm-6pm because no one has conflicts during that time because tutorial occurs during that time.
During the meeting, each person goes over their progress for that week, address concerns anyone has, and plan on what we are going to work on for the following week. Logistics such as asking for code reviewers, team administrivia, and time management are also discussed as needed.

We try to deliver our application iteratively in weekly sprints where each week a new feature will be added to the final application.

Max acts as our scrummaster for each meeting. As the scrummaster, he leads the meeting discussions and manages the team logistics. As well as making sure tasks are being met.

Ivan acts as the product owner. As the product owner, he places himself as the owner of the product and asks questions regarding the design, progress, and direction of the team. He ensures that the requirements are clear and the development of the application is moving in the right direction.

For group note taking during the meetings, we have a rotating schedule where each person except the scrummaster takes a turn being the note taker and takes notes on a text document regarding what was discussed in the meeting that week. The notes are then posted on Slack in the notes channel.

### Team structure
In order to ensure everyone has experience working with different parts of the tech stack, we do not have any predefined sub teams. People pick up different unassigned issues that interest them. This gives the freedom for everyone to explore different parts of the application. This is also beneficial because it ensures that everybody gets an idea of how different parts of the application works and how everything comes together.

### Communication
The method of communication we use is Slack. We have a main channel we use on Slack that serves as the central communication hub for our team. On the main channel, team members ask questions, request code reviews, or talk about other team related topics.

### Issue Mannagement

We use Github issues to keep track of tasks that need to be completed.

During the initial planning phase, we broke down the application scope into several smaller issues that represent tasks that were to be completed for a week. 

Each issue is assigned one of three priority labels: High, Medium, Low. High priority issues relates to features or bugs that are crucial to shipping our final application. At the end of our development cycle, there should be no outstanding high priority issues. Examples of high priority issues include application breaking bugs and missing required features. Medium priority issues relate to issues that should be addressed, however if unresolved they do not prevent our application from going live. Examples of medium priority issues are UI bugs and increasing the code coverage of our tests. Low priority issues are issues that are stretch goals that we might get to if we have time. They are not required, but it would be a bonus if they are addressed. Low priority issues include nice to have features, code refactoring and UI refinement.

We define an issue as an implementation of the application that we think one can finish in a week. If we think a particular feature is too complex and takes more than one week, we assign more people on the issue based on the time to complete estimate. For each additional week, one other person will be assigned to the issue. For example, an issue estimated to take 2 weeks will have two people assigned to it and an issue estimated to take 3 weeks will have 3 people assigned and so on. As new tasks arise, new issues are created on the issue board and assigned a priority value. During our weekly meeting, everyone chooses a new unassigned issue to assign themselves and they work on that particular issue for the week. 

### Backlog
We use Github projects to manage our backlog and completed issues. When issues are first created, they are unassigned and placed in the Backlog. When someone assigns themselves to the issue, it gets moved to In Progress. After the issue is completed, it closed on the issue board and gets moved to Done. We track our progress by taking a look at how many high/medium priority issues are currently in the backlog or in progress.

### Branches
Every feature on in issue is implemented on a separate branch created from the master branch. The master branch designates the most stable and up to date version of our application. At the end of project, the master branch will be our shipped as our final application.

### Pull Request
When someone wishes to add their changes to the master branch, they create a pull request from their branch. The pull request describes the changes included and the corresponding issue number associated with it.

For an issue to be merged, test cases must be included as apart of the changes and there should be no failing test case. Furthermore, the changes need to be reviewed by at least one other group member.

### Shared Documents

For shared documents such as documentation/tutorials, we use Github wiki. We designated the Github wiki to be the central location for documentation and tutorials related to builds, technologies, and credentials.
